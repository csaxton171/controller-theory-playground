## conventional commits

in order to more easily manage versioning and changelog maintenance, we ask that you adhere to the [conventional commit standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

to assist with this, a conventinal commit tool is installed with this solution which will prompt you for a series of commit related questions to yield the correct commit message.

simply staage your changes and `yarn commit` instead of the usual `git commit`.
